### Project Introduction

This project focuses on the server-end coding, combining the 'mysql' database and 'express.js'. I just simply build the simple back-end and front-end data structure. Through the express.js 'Router' lib, I create two different front pages, 'admin' page (localhost:3000/admin) and 'user' page (localhost:3000/). Using express.js and SQL to get the data from, or insert data to, mysql database ('blog' database). The admin page used to interact with database, and the 'user' page just get the data from database and render page by 'angular.js'. Here I realize two parts, 'banner setting' and 'custom setting', the others are similar.

### Project Start

Firstly, need to create the 'blog' databse in 'Navicat' by 'blog.sql' file, and then need to firstly enter the admin page by click 'localhost:3000/admin', and input 'rick' for username and '123456' for password. Secondly, after input correctly, it will enter the default page 'localhost:3000/admin'. I realize two functions, 'banner setting' and 'custom setting'. You can enter to add the data or modify the data with 'blog' database. Finally, we also can enter normal user page 'localhost:3000/', to get the rendered normal front-end page, in which it contains the data from 'blog' data, but can not modify.

### project target

The project focus on the server-end coding, including express.js and SQL, and understanding the basic back-end data querying and rendering.
